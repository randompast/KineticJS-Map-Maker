This is a list of suggestions and brainstorms which have yet to be done.

The list isn't in any particular order.

1) Save function
  //Save to a div?
  a) tmx?
  b) json
  c) array -> row3, column5, y-coordinate = [2][4][1]
    i) can easily stringify the array
    ii) Might also contain z-indexes (may not need more than a handful of diff values)

2) Bucket Tool
  a) topdown / iso versions.
    i) for iso, srcx: tS*(0+i%2+j%2-2*(i%2*j%2))
  b) possibly bucket several tiles (ex: 10x10 (3x3 trees) for a 30x30 grid)

3) Attributes
  a) [2][4][2] = "My attribute"
    i) This could be for mouse overs ex: "Read sign" 
    ii) Or, it could store some other metadata.

4) Logic Layer
  a) Special small layer for collisions 5x5 for each 1 tile?

5) Drawing Guide
  a) The isometric mode is a bit tricky sometimes a gap can occur and it's hard to trace
     A drawing guide which shows every other diamond tile as a rotated chess board would alleviate this

6) Defaults
  a) Start layers as empty?

7) More options in beginning user page
  a) Perhaps a radio button that lets you select through various presets

8) Database
  //perhaps to some public cloud database?
  a) Each time a user saves a map they could name it and upload it to a database for others to use
  b) Each time a player adds a new tile set, or other type of data
  
9) Load
  a) Ability to load a map for continued editing.
    i) global preset variable where you can copy paste previous map data

10) Ability to use multile tilesets
  a) possibly shift+(1,2,3,..)

11) Hide Layers
  a) Hide all other layers and show current H+(1,2,...)
    i) will need to make sure to show layers when selecting normally
  b) Do the same for tilesets
    i) make sure to size the container based off of the dimensions of the largest width/height of the tilesets

12) Usable Controls
  // make this stuff more intuitive!
  a) Particularly, change drag and draw to mousedown+hover
    i)edit via mapProps, mapProps.isMouseDown = true?

13) Figure out some plugins and such...
  a) hope that people like it thus far
